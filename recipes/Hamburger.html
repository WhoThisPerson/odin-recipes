        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, and black pepper. 
                Gently mix the ingredients together, being careful not to overwork the mixture.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into proper patty sizes and shape each patty so it is roughly 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick. 
                Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent them from puffing up during
                cooking.
            </li>
            <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill or skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium temperature.
                Adjust the cooking time according to your preference for doneness.
            </li>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, you can lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster if desired.</li>
            <li>Once the patties are cooked to your liking, remove them from the heat and let them rest for roughly the same amount of time
                they were cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble the hamburgers by placing the patty on the bottom half of the toasted bun. Add your desired toppings.</li>
            <li>Cover each burger with the top half of the bun and it is ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
