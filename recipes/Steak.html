        <h2 class="Ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 steaks (such as ribeye, New York Strip, or filet mignon), about 1 inch thick</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or claified butter (ghee)</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves (smashed)</li>
            <li>Fresh rosemary or thyme sprigs</li>
            <li>Butter (for basting)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="Steps">Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them come up to room temperature for about 30 minutes.
                This allows for even cooking.
            </li>
            <li>Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat. Add the vegetable oil or clarified butter 
                and let it get hot but not smoking.
            </li>
            <li>Carefully place the steaks in the hot skillet, laying them away from you to avoid oil splatter. Cook the steaks
                without moving them for about 3-4 minutes or until a golden crust forms on the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Flip the steaks using tongs and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time 
                based on your desired level of doneness.
            </li>
            <li>Add smashed garlic cloves and fresh rosemary or thyme sprigs to the skillet. Add a pat of butter to the skillet and let it melt.
                Tilt the skillet slightly and use a spoon to continuously baste the steaks with melted butter and aromatics for about 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest on the cutting board or a plate for about 5 minutes. This allows for the juices
                to redistribute and result in a juicier steak.
            </li>
            <li>Slice the steak against the grain (perpendicular to the muscle fibers) into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Serve the steak slices immediately, optionally with a side of your choice, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or fresh salad.</li>
        </ol>
